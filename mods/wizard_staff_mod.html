				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				This Thaumcraft-inspired mod adds in a wand with foci. It currently contains 8 different foci, but I plan to add more later.<br>
				<br>
				- Wizard Staff - This is the first item you need. To select a focus, click the circle in the bottom-right corner and select the focus you'd like to use. Every action costs durability of this wand. It has a durability of 4096.<br>
				- Advanced Wizard Staff - Same as the Wizard Staff, but has 10x more durability (40960). Is crafted with a Diamond Block and a diamond instead of 2 diamonds <br>
				- Portable Hole Focus - This focus makes a temporary 3x3x16 hole in a wall, so you can walk through it - One use costs 256 durability<br>
				- Healing Focus - Upon use, will heal the player half a heart at the time - One use costs 128 durability<br>
				- Harming - This focus has two levels: Harming I will do 6 half-hearts of damage and costs 12 durability per hit, and Harming II will do 10 half-hearts of damage and costs 16 durability per hit. <br>
				- Shielding - When you use this focus you'll be invincible for 15 seconds, and all damage will be negated - One use costs 256 durability. After use, this focus has a cooldown period of 60 seconds<br>
				- Floating - When you're holding your wand with this focus, you'll no longer fall like a brick, but you'll float down like a chicken, and recieve no fall damage - This focus costs 20 durability per second whilst falling<br>
				- Relocation - Tap a block with this focus and it'll disappear. It'll be placed down where you click next. Chests and Furnaces will keep their content while doing this - One block movement costs 256 durability<br>
				- Equal Trade - Tap a block and that block, and all the blocks around it of the same type will be replaced with the block you have in the slot after your wand - Each replacement costs 8 durability - It will replace a maximum of 32 blocks in one click<br>
				<br>
				Crafting recipes can be found at the end of the video V<br>

				<h3>Installation - IMPORTANT</h3>
				The download will be a zip file that contains both the script and a folder named WizardStaffMod. You can import the script in your own way, but you have to copy that WizardStaffMod folder to the /games/com.mojang/ folder on your internal storage/sd-card. If you don't, this mod wont work.<br>
